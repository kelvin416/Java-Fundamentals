*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:
*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day
        SELECT * FROM ticket
        where departure = "2023-07-25";
*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day
        SELECT * FROM ticket
        WHERE departure = "2023-07-25"
        AND destination = "Germany";
*       3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities today
        SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name, t.ticket_no, t.destination
        FROM passenger p
        JOIN ticket t
        ON p.passenger_id = t.passenger_id
        WHERE t.plane_id = 17;
*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight
        SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name, p.email, p. age, t.ticket_no, t.destination, t.departure, t.arrival
        FROM passenger p
        JOIN ticket t
        ON p.passenger_id = t.passenger_id
        WHERE p.passenger_id = 1;
*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday
        SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name, p.email, p.age, t.ticket_no
        FROM passenger p
        JOIN ticket t
        ON p.passenger_id = t.passenger_id
        WHERE t.departure = "2023-07-25"
        AND t.passenger_id = 2;
*       6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities this week, month, and year
        SELECT COUNT(t.destination) as Flights
        FROM ticket t
        WHERE destination BETWEEN "Germany" AND "Kenya"
        AND current_country BETWEEN "Germany" AND "Kenya";
        AND departure BETWEEN "2023-06-25" AND "2023-07-25";
*       7.) Query the number of passengers that travelled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year
        SELECT COUNT(t.passenger_id) as Passengers
        FROM ticket t
        WHERE destination BETWEEN "Germany" AND "Kenya"
        AND current_country BETWEEN "Germany" AND "Kenya"
        AND departure BETWEEN "2023-06-25" AND "2023-07-25";
*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports
        INSERT INTO destination (country_name, city, airport_name)
        VALUES ("Kenya", "Mombasa", "Moi International Airport");
*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights
        INSERT INTO ticket (ticket_no, plane_id, passenger_id, current_country, destination, departure, arrival, max_weight, price)
        VALUES ("022AC", 15, 6, "Egypt", "Kenya", "2023-05-23", "2023-05-26", 23.00, 250);
*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight
        UPDATE ticket
        SET max_weight = 46
        WHERE passenger_id = 5;
*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)
